# OmoAI Requirements

## 1. Introduction

This document specifies the functional and non-functional requirements for the OmoAI project. It serves as a guide for the development and testing of the system.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1. Audio Processing

*   **FR1.1:** The system must be able to accept audio files in various formats (e.g., MP3, WAV, FLAC, etc.).
*   **FR1.2:** The system must convert all input audio to a standardized format (16kHz mono WAV) before processing.
*   **FR1.3:** The system must be able to handle long audio files by splitting them into smaller, manageable chunks.

### 2.2. ASR and Transcription

*   **FR2.1:** The system must transcribe the audio into text with a primary focus on the Vietnamese language.
*   **FR2.2:** The system must generate timestamps for each segment of the transcript.
*   **FR2.3:** The system must provide word-level timestamps for the transcript.

### 2.3. Post-processing

*   **FR3.1:** The system must automatically add punctuation and capitalization to the raw transcript.
*   **FR3.2:** The system must be able to generate a concise summary of the transcript.
*   **FR3.3:** The system must be able to generate a list of key topics with their corresponding timestamps.

### 2.4. API

*   **FR4.1:** The system must expose a RESTful API for submitting audio files and retrieving transcription results.
*   **FR4.2:** The API must provide a health check endpoint to monitor the status of the service.
*   **FR4.3:** The API must provide a metrics endpoint for monitoring performance.
*   **FR4.4:** The API must support different output formats, including JSON, plain text, SRT, and VTT.

### 2.5. Configuration

*   **FR5.1:** All aspects of the system must be configurable through a central configuration file.
*   **FR5.2:** The system must validate the configuration at startup and provide clear error messages for invalid configurations.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Performance

*   **NFR1.1:** The system should process audio in a timely manner. The real-time factor (RTF) should be configurable and monitored.
*   **NFR1.2:** The API should have low latency for health checks and status requests.

### 3.2. Scalability

*   **NFR2.1:** The system should be designed to be scalable, allowing for the addition of more processing nodes to handle increased load.
*   **NFR2.2:** The system should be able to handle multiple concurrent requests.

### 3.3. Reliability

*   **NFR3.1:** The system should be robust and handle errors gracefully.
*   **NFR3.2:** The system should provide detailed logs for debugging and monitoring.
*   **NFR3.3:** In case of a failure in one of the pipeline stages, the system should log the error and, if possible, return a partial result.

### 3.4. Maintainability

*   **NFR4.1:** The code should be well-structured, documented, and easy to understand.
*   **NFR4.2:** The system should have a comprehensive suite of automated tests, including unit tests and integration tests.

### 3.5. Security

*   **NFR5.1:** The system should not expose any sensitive information in its logs or API responses.
*   **NFR5.2:** Access to the API should be controlled, and authentication/authorization mechanisms should be considered for production deployments.
