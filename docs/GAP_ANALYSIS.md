### BUG-002: API Include Filtering for Summary and Timestamped Summary [RESOLVED]

**Status**: ✅ Fixed
**Date**: 2025-09-16
**Component**: API Response Filtering
**Severity**: Medium

**Description**:
The `summary` field was being included in API responses even when not explicitly listed in the `output.api_defaults.include` setting from `config.yaml`. The filtering logic only applied to `segments` and `transcript_punct` fields, ignoring both `summary` and `timestamped_summary`.

**Root Cause**:
The filtering logic in [`src/omoai/api/services.py`](src/omoai/api/services.py:783-789) was incomplete - it only checked for `segments` and `transcript_punct` in the include list, but did not filter `summary` or `timestamped_summary` fields.

**Impact**:

- API responses always included summary data regardless of configuration
- Users could not exclude summary fields to reduce response size
- Configuration settings were not being respected for summary-related fields

**Fix Applied**:

1. **Enhanced Filtering Logic**: Added checks for `summary` and `timestamped_summary` in the include filtering logic
2. **Updated Model Definitions**: Added `"summary"` as a valid literal in [`OutputFormatParams`](src/omoai/api/models.py:34) and [`MainController.pipeline`](src/omoai/api/main_controller.py:42)
3. **Fixed Model Consistency**: Removed incorrect `timestamped_summary` parameter from [`PostprocessResponse`](src/omoai/api/services.py:345)
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Created unit and integration tests to verify the fix

**Files Modified**:

- [`src/omoai/api/services.py`](src/omoai/api/services.py) - Core filtering logic enhancement
- [`src/omoai/api/models.py`](src/omoai/api/models.py) - Added "summary" literal support
- [`src/omoai/api/main_controller.py`](src/omoai/api/main_controller.py) - Updated method signature
- [`tests/test_api_include_filtering.py`](tests/test_api_include_filtering.py) - Unit tests for filtering logic
- [`tests/test_api_include_integration.py`](tests/test_api_include_integration.py) - Integration tests
- [`docs/API_INCLUDE_FILTERING_FIX.md`](docs/API_INCLUDE_FILTERING_FIX.md) - Documentation

**Test Coverage**:

- ✅ Unit tests for include filtering logic
- ✅ Integration tests with configuration validation
- ✅ Model definition validation tests
- ✅ Backward compatibility tests

**Verification**:
All tests pass, including new API include filtering tests. The fix ensures that both `summary` and `timestamped_summary` fields are only included when explicitly requested via the `include` parameter.

### BUG-001: CUDA Multiprocessing Fork Initialization Error [RESOLVED]

**Status**: ✅ Fixed
**Date**: 2025-09-12
**Component**: Post-processing pipeline
**Severity**: High

**Description**:
RuntimeError: "Cannot re-initialize CUDA in forked subprocess. To use CUDA with multiprocessing, you must use the 'spawn' start method"

**Root Cause**:
vLLM engine initialization in subprocess was failing because CUDA was already initialized in the parent process, and the default multiprocessing method on Linux ('fork') doesn't allow CUDA re-initialization.

**Impact**:

- Post-processing pipeline completely broken
- Affects all API calls that require punctuation/summarization
- Blocks entire audio processing workflow

**Fix Applied**:

1. Added multiprocessing spawn method enforcement in [`scripts/post.py`](scripts/post.py:11-13)
2. Enhanced CUDA isolation in [`src/omoai/api/scripts/postprocess_wrapper.py`](src/omoai/api/scripts/postprocess_wrapper.py:35-42)
3. Added comprehensive logging for diagnostics
4. Created unit tests to prevent regression

**Files Modified**:

- [`scripts/post.py`](scripts/post.py) - Added multiprocessing spawn method
- [`src/omoai/api/scripts/postprocess_wrapper.py`](src/omoai/api/scripts/postprocess_wrapper.py) - Enhanced CUDA isolation
- [`tests/test_cuda_multiprocessing_fix.py`](tests/test_cuda_multiprocessing_fix.py) - Regression tests

**Test Coverage**:

- ✅ Unit tests for multiprocessing spawn method
- ✅ CUDA context isolation tests
- ✅ Environment variable validation
- ✅ Full integration test suite passing

**Verification**:
All tests pass, including new CUDA multiprocessing compatibility tests. The fix ensures vLLM can initialize in subprocesses without CUDA conflicts.

## Previous Issues (Resolved)

### No Previous Issues

No previous issues - this is the first documented issue.

## Prevention Measures

1. **Automated Testing**: New unit tests prevent regression of CUDA multiprocessing issues
2. **Environment Validation**: Enhanced logging helps diagnose future CUDA-related issues
3. **Code Review**: All subprocess calls should now include proper CUDA isolation
4. **Documentation**: Updated troubleshooting guides with CUDA multiprocessing best practices

## Monitoring

- Monitor logs for "CUDA" and "multiprocessing" related warnings
- Watch for subprocess failures in post-processing pipeline
- Track performance impact of spawn vs fork methods
